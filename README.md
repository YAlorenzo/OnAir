## Description
OnAir is an online platform that simulates a cinema experience where users can search for movies by title, sort them by categories, and explore three main sections: Movies, TV Shows, and Series. While users cannot watch movies directly on the platform, they can access detailed information about each film, including ratings, trailers, descriptions, cast information, and user reviews.

## Features

- **Category Filters**: Sort movies by various categories.
- **Sections**: Navigate through the tabs "Movies," "Series," and "TV Shows."
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout.
- **Movie Details**: View ratings, trailers, descriptions, and cast information.
- **User Reviews**: Write and read reviews for movies.

## Tech Stack

- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **API**: TMDB (The Movie Database) - a free, open movie database API

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project was to practice working with APIs, including fetching and processing data, as well as sending requests to the server. The project also emphasizes creating a responsive user interface and effectively managing state in a web application.
